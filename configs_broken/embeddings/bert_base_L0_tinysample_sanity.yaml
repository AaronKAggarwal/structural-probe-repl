# For embeddings extracted from bert-base-cased on the TINY_SAMPLE,
# specifically targeting what was originally BERT's layer 0 (initial embeddings).

# This layer_index is the index into the stack of layers saved in the HDF5 file.
# Your extraction saved layers [0, 6, 12] from the original BERT model.
# - To use original BERT layer 0 (initial embeddings), layer_index here is 0.
# - To use original BERT layer 6, layer_index here is 1.
# - To use original BERT layer 12, layer_index here is 2.
layer_index: 0 # Selects the first layer in the HDF5 (which is original BERT layer 0)

paths:
  # Path to the HDF5 file generated by extract_embeddings.py for the TINY_SAMPLE
  # The filename includes which layers were extracted.
